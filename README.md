# Background & Motivation

Walk with me and you might find yourself walking ahead alone, realizing I've stopped to look at something. You may wonder why I stare so intently at the cracks in the concrete, whiteout on a sign post, or waxy scribbles on an alleyway dumpster. People like me, senses restless when confronted with an empty brick wall, eyes reflexively locking onto underpasses, rooftops, benches, light poles, and alleyways. I'm thankful for every train ride I've ever taken, every time I've wondered how they got up there, and every opportunity I have to be caught in the grip of the city. This project is my love letter to graffiti. https://vandalsquat.org

The application serves as a tool to catalog graffiti flicks in an ordered format, where you can list the writer's name, crew, a description of the piece, and the address it was taken it. The address works as a geocoding tool for a map that shows you where you've taken graffiti flicks, and who was up when you took it. Like a Strava for graff, showing you where you've been and where you could go to find more graff. Enjoy, it's pretty easy to use.

This app is **NOT FOR ACTIVE WRITERS**, it's for half-stepping nerds like me who want to catalog the pieces we see in the street. You should know better than to post your own work to a geolocating app that could be used to trace your movements. For now, this app will **ONLY SHOW YOU YOUR OWN PICTURES** because that way I won't be providing an information platform for vandal squads or rats.

If you ever knew a chubby brown guy whose friends called him NEMO, peace.
